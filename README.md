# Con-coord

An Ajax based maps website that allows users to create a profile and create their own collection of maps of their favoutrite places. They can place pins on their maps, add a description and title to each map and each pin. 

Users can see the maps of other users and 'fly' the main map (see gif below) to the centre of any of the created maps just by clicking on the smaller maps. Users can like maps, drop pins and see maps they have created, liked and any maps they have collaborated on. 

This project was built in one week using the Leaflet API and Express, Node, Jquery PSQL and Bootstrap for the Lighthouse Labs midterm team project.
